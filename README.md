# Rockflows-Overview
Welcome to the Rockflows organization on GitHub! This repository serves as the central hub for all our projects, providing an overview and links to each individual repository.

## About Rockflows
Rockflows is dedicated to creating machine learning (ML) workflows tailored to problem-solving needs. We pursue several operational objectives:
1. Constructing a suitable workflow based on data and business requirements.
2. Retrieving similar past experiments based on data information, business requirements, and algorithmic choices.
3. Automatically enriching the knowledge base from past experiences.
4. Discovering new knowledge by exploring past experiments.
5. (In progress) Automatically determining the profile of an ML workflow.
6. (In progress) Automatically verifying that an ML workflow adheres to best practices.
7. (In progress) Automatically verifying that an ML workflow meets FATES properties (during construction or deployment).
8. (In progress) Automatically justifying best practices through proof construction and justification diagrams.

The project has been ongoing for nine years, exploring various dimensions evident in the different repositories listed below. Today, we aim to provide a more structured framework, leveraging the lessons learned.
